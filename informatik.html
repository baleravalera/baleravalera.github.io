                <p>Prompt/alert: An alert box is often used if you want to make sure information comes through to the user.
Variable: Variables are containers for storing data (var x = 5).
If-statements: You can use conditional statements in your code to perform different actions for different decisions (if, else, else if, switch).
While-loop: Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.
Datatyper: To be able to operate on variables, it is important to know something about the datatype (let x = 15 + "example").
Funktioner: A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task,  it gets executed when "something" calls it (function).
Arrays: An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value.</p>

                <p>"Pou 2" - Our first serious project was about making our own prototype. We were three in our group - Signe, Kristoffer and I. It was a difficult mission for us to find an idea of what our prototype should be about, but since we used three phases - Assess, desing and build, it became easier. We made a decision to start on a game called "Pou", and the main idea was to "recreate" the game, make it better. Most of our classmates have played this game when we were younger, and we all had our own wishes about what could make this game better. So we made our wishes become true!</p>

                <p>"Flappy Bird" - We have practiced on new codes, consoles, variables and datatypes, operators, arrays and some other interesting things by trying them on a Flappy Bird game. I made changes to the game such as the art (unicorn, pink clouds, pink diamond, hearts, candy, other sounds). The cost of a coin is 1, the diamond is 5, and the value of a heart is 10. I also added a complication to the game, that is, the more coins, hearts and diamonds you collect, the faster lolipops will move. </p>

                <p>"WordPress" - We have started on planning, designing, and making our own site. Wordpress is easy in a way, that ther is no need to use any of the languages like html, css, javascript. We could use the page as our own page as portfolie, that's why I got an idea about telling my life story step by step(with pictures). </p>
